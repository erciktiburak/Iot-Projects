# Electronic Voting System with Arduino Uno in Tinkercad
## Aim
This project aims to create an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) using Arduino.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand and learn the working principles of multiple push buttons and LCD interfacing with Arduino.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- LCD Screen 
- Resistors
- Push Buttons
- Wires

## Short Description 
This project is an Electronic Voting System that utilizes push buttons for voting and an LCD screen to display the results after the "Result" button is pressed.

## Workflow of the Project
- The Electronic Voting Machine Using Arduino is designed to register votes when buttons are pressed.
- Each push button press will increment a variable associated with the respective candidate/button.
- Upon pressing the "Result" button, the system displays the election results on the connected LCD screen.

## Setup Instructions
- Use Tinkercad or a similar circuit simulation tool.
- Set up the circuit as demonstrated in the attached circuit diagram.
- Use the provided Arduino code.
- Start the simulation.
- Click on any of the first four buttons to cast a vote.
- Press the last button after casting votes to view the results.
- The results will be displayed on the connected LCD.
